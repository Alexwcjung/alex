    "Unfortunately, this is not a reality that everyone shares. Many people around the world don‚Äôt wake up in a soft and comfortable bed. Instead, they open their eyes to see a dirt floor or a leaking roof.",
    "One day, I learned about a program that needed volunteers to go to different parts of the world to help build houses for the poor. After watching a presentation about it, I decided to take part in the next volunteer trip.",
    "The volunteers and I got to meet the family. We had to slowly take apart the family‚Äôs hut to get more bricks and other materials for the new house.",
    "After another week, the home was finally finished. On the last day, we had a party to celebrate the completion of the new house.",
    "This experience has inspired me to continue building houses for others. I hope it will also encourage my friends and family members to help out in the future."
