st.write("I am currently teaching English at Gyeongnam Automobile High School, where I aim to support students in becoming confident, autonomous learners by incorporating digital literacy and fostering engaging, student-centered approaches. I recently completed my Masterâ€™s degree at Gyeongsang National University (GNU), specializing in corpus-based research that analyzed differences between spoken and written English. My research focused on Register-Specific Variations in GET-Passives: Comparing Written and Spoken English. I am now beginning my Ph.D. at GNU, with a focus on phonetics, phonology, and the integration of digital tools into English education. With a deep interest in learning and teaching English more effectively, I hope to contribute to the advancement of digital literacy and innovative teaching practices in education. I am eager to collaborate with others who share these interests and continue learning from their experiences.")
