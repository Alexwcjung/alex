st.write("Sometimes you may feel upset when you wake up suddenly from a **nightmare** (<span title="Meaning: A frightening or unpleasant dream. Grammar: noun">nightmare</span>), but you can always **let out a sigh of relief** (<span title="Meaning: To breathe deeply, expressing relief. Grammar: phrase">let out a sigh of relief</span>). 

No matter how scary the dream was, at least you’ve woken up **safe and sound** (<span title="Meaning: Unharmed and in good condition. Grammar: phrase">safe and sound</span>) in your own home.

Unfortunately, this is not a reality that everyone shares. Many people around the world don’t wake up in a **soft and comfortable** (<span title="Meaning: Pleasant to touch and providing ease. Grammar: adjective phrase">soft and comfortable</span>) bed. Instead, they open their eyes to see a **leaking roof** (<span title="Meaning: A roof that lets in water due to damage. Grammar: noun phrase">leaking roof</span>).

One day, I learned about a program that needed **volunteers** (<span title="Meaning: People who offer their time to help others without pay. Grammar: noun">volunteers</span>) to go to different parts of the world to **help build houses** (<span title="Meaning: To assist in constructing homes. Grammar: verb phrase">help build houses</span>) for the poor.

After watching a presentation about it, I decided to take part in the next volunteer trip. The volunteers and I got to meet the family. We had to slowly take apart the family’s **hut** (<span title="Meaning: A small, simple shelter. Grammar: noun">hut</span>) to get more **bricks** (<span title="Meaning: Blocks made of clay or stone used for building. Grammar: noun">bricks</span>) and other materials for the new house.

After another week, the home was finally finished. On the last day, we had a party to celebrate the completion of the new house. This **experience** (<span title="Meaning: A specific event or occurrence that leaves an impression. Grammar: noun">experience</span>) has **inspired** (<span title="Meaning: To motivate someone to act or feel strongly about something. Grammar: verb">inspired</span>) me to continue building houses for others. I hope it will also **encourage** (<span title="Meaning: To give support or confidence to someone. Grammar: verb">encourage</span>) my friends and family members to help out in the future.
